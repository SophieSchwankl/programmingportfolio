## 2022-2023 Programming Projects

### Snake Game 
Snake Game built in Processing Python Mode 

In my group project with Liam Scott, Lucas Jackson, Xuanthao Tran, Lilla Morrow, and Lauren(Ren) Barklow. I was the project manager, trying to tie together the graphics with the coding, but I ened up doing most of the programming in the end. We did also get help from Luca DalCanto who helped us find what our issue was with the code (with the move method of the food).
